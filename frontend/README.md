Yet Another Warhammer Underworlds (D)[eck][ata] (B)[uilder][ase]

### Setup
- Fork the repo first.
- Make sure you have `node` and `yarn`
- Install dependecies with `yarn`

Project uses Firebase for user management and a node/mongodb backend. 
In order to run locally you need to create `.env.development` file in the project root.
Ask mainteners for environment variables values.

If you want to be able to authenticate while running locally you need to get in touch with
maintainers so they will add your IP to a Firebase's project white list.

Run locally with `yarn dev`.

### ToDo

- Check whole validation for play formats logic
